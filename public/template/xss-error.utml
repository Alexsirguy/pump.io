<h1>Security error</h1>
<p>You need to upgrade your browser - or even better, switch to another one like <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://google.com/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>. You can consider using a <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/Clients">client</a>, but the best course of action is to upgrade.</p>
<p>This is happening because your browser is outdated and a malicious post can trick it into giving an attacker your private information, including access to your pump.io account and messages. Because of this, pump.io is refusing to show any content.</p>
<p>For your protection, this error cannot be overridden or disabled. Sorry about that.</p>
